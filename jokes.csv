"All he had in his possession was a shoe lace and $10.00. While he was in prison, all he could think about was eating pussy. That is all he wanted to do when he finally got out.

Now that he was out and had some money, he went to the nearest whorehouse to fulfill his dream. He went up to the counter, slapped his $10.00 bill on the counter, and told the person, “I want to eat some pussy.”

Three engineers went out for drinks after work. An electrical engineer, a mechanical engineer and a civil engineer. They rehashed their respective jobs, complained about the hours and all agreed about insane expectations and demands of clients. After a couple drinks they started loosening up, discussing things other than work when the topic of who designed the human body came up.

The mechanical engineer stated matter of factly that the way the muscles move the bones is all just a system of what amounts to pulleys and levers. He stated bluntly that the body must have been designed by a ME.

The electrical engineer wasn't having any of that; in a somewhat exasperated tone he explained how the entire body functions on electrical impulses, the brain stores memory via synapses firing and the signal to the involuntary systems and muscles are all electrical impulses. The EE demanded that the nervous system is far more complex, so the body must have been designed by an electrical engineer. . The two each confident in their reasoning and asked the civil engineer to break the stalemate, certain the CE wouldn't even attempt to offer a third option. They pressed him to choose who was right.

The CE, the quietest of the three. sat thinking over what was said for what seemed like an eternity for the other two. He suddenly spoke up telling them they were both wrong, and went back to his beer. His friends pestered him to explain himself. one of them had to be correct. Finally the CE spoke again and stated that it had to be a civil engineer who designed the human body.

At night, the lion came to the village and caught a goat. Upon hearing the screams of the poor goat, the hunter immediately grabbed his gun and started following the blood trail using his torch. At the entrance of dark jungle, hunter saw that the lion got caught in one of his traps, with half eaten goat besides him. Lion’s eyes were glowing in torch light, blood streaks on his mouth. Suddenly the lion let out a nerve wrecking growl at the hunter all the while struggling to release itself from the trap. 

The hunter with years of experience at hand remained calm and reached for his rifle. When the hunter straightened his rifle, he realized that due to dark and haste, he had accidentally grabbed his umbrella instead of the rifle. 

The hunter using the torch light saw a stone nearby and grabbed it so he can squash the lion’s head. During this, the lion had managed to free himself from the trap and lunged towards the hunter. In midair, there’s a huge bang and lion fell in hunter’s feet with a bullet hole in his head.

After entering the room, the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen approaches him and sits him on the bed. They have passionate lovemaking for 25 minutes and he finishes inside of her.

"There's a far-off place that consists of a perfectly triangular lake surrounded by land, with three kingdoms on the three sides of the lake:

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people.  

The second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power, too. 

The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.

The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, since it's a valuable resource to own outright.

The 1st kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor and each with their own personal squire.

The 2nd kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armor and a few dozen squires of their own. 

The 3rd kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.

The night before the big battle:

The knights in the 1st kingdom drink and are merry, partying into the late hours of the night. 

The knights in the 2nd kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink into the late hours of the night. 

In the 3rd camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. he fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.

The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hung over and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up.

In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. the battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing the squire from the 3rd kingdom.

And the moral of the story is:

The squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",Jokes,Three kingdoms at war

Eventually, their king became frustrated and called a meeting of the tribe's elders. He said he wanted them to figure out a way he could enjoy his wealth, and stay within traditional guidelines.

After much consideration, the elders suggested he build a magnificent throne. When he objected there was not enough room in his hut for a throne, the elders suggested he call in an engineer to solve the problem.

Soon, the king's tiny hut was rigged with an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys. He could lower the huge throne for use during the day, and at night, he could haul the throne up, and lower his bed. This was truly the best of both worlds for the king.

Unfortunately, after a few months of constant use, the ropes frayed, and one night, the throne slipped and came crashing down on the king, killing him.

The wise men of the island recognized a lesson in this experience and added to the lore of their people this statement: ""People who live in grass houses should not stow thrones.""",Jokes,There was once an island kingdom whose people were all fabulously wealthy.

He searched through many villages for someone he could deem his successor. Eventually he came across a promising young lad by the name of Lincoln.

""Lincoln, my boy,"" said Robin Hood, ""When I am gone from this world, I want you to be the one to carry on my legacy. Even the great name of Robin Hood will one day be yours.""

""Thank you very much, sir,"" responded Lincoln. ""Please pass as much knowledge on to me as you can so I can properly lead the Merry Men after you have passed away.""

""Very well then. The first lesson you need to learn is survival."" said Robin Hood. ""Grill as much meat as possible in the wilderness, and then bring it to me as proof that you know how to sustain yourself in the wilderness. On top of that, you will also need to learn to cook the meat regularly so I can be well-fed and taken care of in my old age.""

Lincoln agreed. He took minimal supplies out into the forest and began grilling as much meat as he could find. When he was done, he brought it back for Robin Hood to enjoy.

As time went on, the Merry Men began to notice an abundance of meat in Robin Hood's residence. Robin Hood's good friend, Friar Tuck, approached him directly about this.

""I don't understand how you got all this meat, Robin,"" he said.

20 years pass by and in that time they have fallen less and less in touch until one day the friend that settled down in Familyville (we will call him Ralph) called the friend that moved out to Las Vegas (we will call him PJ) out of the blue. Ralph is crying and sobbing uncontrollably into the phone and all PJ can really understand is that Ralph's marriage of 18 years is ending, his 17 year old and his 16 year old turned out to not even be his biological children, but instead their former neighbor's instead, and that he just got laid off from his incredible job at Important CareerTech. PJ calms Ralph down and invites him to come to Vegas for a week and that PJ would pay for a hotel room and pay for almost any expense while Ralph visited. Ralph took a flight to Las Vegas and they met at the airport, went to their room, got changed and got ready to get into some fun.

After a night of gambling, drinking, doing what was said to be cocaine and getting into various trouble, they retreated to the hotel room to get some rest. Once they got there Ralph turned to PJ and asked, ""hey is it true that prostitutes are legal out here man?""

PJ replied coolly, ""hey man have some respect- they prefer to be called escorts. But yes, they are legal out here depending where you go.""

Ralph explains how his wife barely ever wanted to have sex, let alone fool around, and that despite her cold decline to any physical advances that Ralph has made he never sought it from anywhere else. For 18 years in their marriage they had only made love a handful of times and after finding out she had been having a full blown affair with a neighbor before he'd moved away he felt absolutely ruined. ""So that's why I want to use an *escort* then,"" explained Ralph. ""I don't have much money to spare for this so the cheaper the better, and I'm not picky.""

PJ warns him, ""are you *sure* it doesn't matter who you get? I know a really cheap place, but the women aren't your typical escorts.""

Ralph excitedly says, ""I'll take anything man. Where do I go?!""

PJ tells him to slow down. He asks one thing of Ralph: ""can you promise me **you won't ask for Sandpaper Sally?**"" Ralph agrees, brushes past that, and impatiently asks for directions to this establishment.

PJ lays out the directions as follows: take the main strip all the way to the end and make a left at the very last casino. Follow that road until you find a broken sign with graffiti all over it, mostly penises, and make a right onto the dirt road. Follow that for about a mile until there is a giant boulder resembling a face, then make a left into the desert. Don't lose faith in driving on the roadless desert as before you know it you'll find a large cabin with a red light shining on the porch. Knock three times and you will be able to take care of the rest. 

***""Just don't ask for Sandpaper Sally""***

So Ralph drove his rental car down the main strip, took a left at the last casino, a right at the dick sign, a left at the creepy rock face and found the cabin. He knocked three times and a plump elderly woman answered the door, smoking a cigar, and with an indistinguishable accent asks, ""you here for girls?"" Ralph nodded and she yelled ""GIRLS!"" while fighting back a phlegmy cough.

One by one the escorts lined up from their rooms. One by one they got worse and worse in appearance. The first escort was absolutely malnourished, skinny and clammy looking. The second escort was overweight, but in a very odd way- to Ralph she resembled Squidward after he ate the vault of Krabby Patties in that all of her obesity was only in her thighs and nowhere else. The third escort had some kind of rash throughout her body and one of her legs was noticeably at least six inches longer than the other. The next few became less and less attractive to Ralph, and as he was about to give up hope, an angel stepped out into the entrance area. [Imagine your idea of a beautiful woman and that's exactly what he saw.]

Without hesitation he asked for her services. She approached him and introduced herself in a very sultry, steamy voice: ""Hey you. I'm Sally."" It echoed in his head what PJ had warned. He wasn't supposed to ask for Sandpaper Sally. He concluded PJ was a fucking idiot and locked arms with Sally as she escorted him to her room. 

When they got in the room, she asked what he wanted and he said ""anything. I'm desperate and not picky."" He got on top of her, stuck it in and started going at it. Five seconds in he pulls out screaming. His dick felt as if it were being stuck with pins and needles. Sally asked if there was a problem and, embarrassed to tell her his issue, said there wasn't. So he tried again. Five seconds in and he pulls out screaming in pain again. He didn't know what to do!

""Oh honey, I think I know how to fix your little...*problem*. Sally got up and went to the bathroom connected to her room and said, ""I'll be right back, sweetie. Don't go running off."" 

Five minutes pass. 300 seconds. An eternity to Ralph. Just as he was about to get up, get dressed and leave she came out of the bathroom and Ralph figured he would try once more. So he got atop her and put it in, started going at it and..... it was great! 3 or 4 minutes later he had had the best sex of his entire life. It was absolutely magical compared to his cheating soon-to-be ex wife. Ralph was blown away.

After they both got dressed again Ralph turned to Sally and said, ""So I have to ask you how you did that. How did you fix my problem? It was incredible after you went to the bathroom.

""Oh honey that's easy. Third drawer down in my bathroom is where I keep my sandpaper for my scabs.""",Jokes,"Two guys become inseparable friends in college.

'OK,' says the girl, 'I charge 20 an hour.'

'..ist goot, but I must varn you, I am a little kinky.'

'No problem,' she replies cautiously, 'I can do little kinky.'

So off they go to the girl's flat, where the German produces four large bedsprings and a duck caller. 'I vant zat you tie ze springs to each of your hans und knees.' The girl finds this most odd, but complies, fastening the springs as he had said, to her hands and knees. 'Now you vill get on your hans und knees.'

She duly does this, balancing precariously on the springs.

'You vill please to blow zis kwacker as I make love to you.'

"When Jesus Christ was a very young boy of 8 or 9 years, he did all the things other boys of his age did. He played with his toys and ran with his friends. But like most little boys that age, he really wanted a puppy. He begged Joseph to let him have one but Joseph said he wasn't ready for the responsibility.

Well Jesus continued to beg and beg and promise to be responsible. And then one day, Joseph came home with a puppy and Jesus was so happy.

""Now Jesus, this dog is your responsibility."", said Joseph.

""Yes, I know."", said Jesus.

""You need to feed him every day.""

""I will.""

""You need to brush him every day""

""I will.""

""And you need to make sure he gets lots of exercise every day.""

The very next day Joseph comes home from a long day or carpentry and hears Jesus crying in his room. He sees the boy sitting there holding a leash eyes full of tears and no puppy to be found.

""Jesus, what's wrong? Where is your dog?""

Between heaving sobs, Jesus said ""He...he...died.""

Joseph was shocked. ""Died!? It's only been a day. Did you feed the dog?""

 After a short lull in their conversation, Paddy turns to Mary and asks, ""Do you know what I miss most of all?""

 She asks, ""What?''

 ""Sex."" he replies.

 Mary exclaims, ""Why you old toot. You couldn't get it up if I held a gun to your head!""

 ""Well, I can oblige,"" says Mary, who unzips his trousers, removes his manhood and proceeds to hold it.

Afterward, they agree to meet secretly each night in the garden where they would sit and talk and Mary would hold Paddy's thingie.

Then one night Paddy didn't show up at their usual meeting place. Alarmed, Mary decided to find him and make sure he was O.K.

She walked around the Senior Citizen Home where she found him sitting by the pool with Ethel, another female resident, who was holding Paddy's little pal!

himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having

sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

"So A few years ago I worked at a small, regional bank as a security guard. There were always two of us stationed at the location, and one of the guys I was usually with recently quit due to other prospects. So, naturally, they hired a new guy.

I was the most senior of the guys, so I was in charge of showing the new guy how we do things on this location (and honestly, a well-dressed monkey could do it). I usually came along great with people, and expected nothing else with this guy. Until he came through the doors.

Big, terrifying, arms bigger than my legs. I was a bit taken aback, but I greeted him with an open mind. We didn't get to exchange pleasantries to the extent I usually like to with the new hires, but I at least (from the accent and the name) figured he was Slavic or something along those lines, and he seemed friendly enough. I figured we would get to know each other a little better over lunch.

I showed him around the usual ""rotation"" we made through the bank. I made a few wise-cracks here and there, but he was dead-serious. My jokes, as stupid and dad-like as they are, usually at least landed a giggle or chuckle.

We came to the end of the rotation, ending in the small space they have for us to eat lunch. Cramped, two chairs, a small table. Not something to write home about, so to speak.

Anyway, we had a small desk-safe on the table were we could keep valuables we didn't want to carry around all day. It was a replica of the big safe of the bank, with a little sticker I had printed out on the label-maker.

I looked over at the new guy, and mustered up the courage to deliver the final joke. I told him that this was the replacement safe for the bank.

He looked me dead-serious in the eyes, picked up the safe, and said;

""This joke!""

*We must celebrate, let's have a drink, what do you have on you?*

*I only have a few Euros, and you?*

*Me too, hardly enough to have a nice drinking day.*

After a moment of silence, the older one says: *I have an idea. The mess in the church over there has just started. I go in there and make a great show. I once was famous for my acting, you just wait and see...*

He steps loudly into the church and starts in a prayers voice: *Behold, I am Jesus Christ, and I am born again, come to me brothers and sisters* with these words he goes around offering hugs, as he comes towards the priest...

The priest overwhelmed by the odour of this man moves away and tells his clergy: *give him the collection and he will be on his way.*

5min later the old homeless man comes out of the church and with a big grin he shows his accomplishment.

So the young man, inspiriert by this, believes he can achieve the same result. He looks around and sees another house of God.

I pulled up a gravel laneway and parked next to the barn. An old farmer was working on his tractor.

""Excuse me,"" I said, ""but I couldn't help but notice your sign. Is it true you have a talking dog for sale?""

""Yeah,"" grumbled the old farmer. ""He's out back. Go have a look and tell me what you think.""

I walked out back behind the farmhouse and spotted a fenced-in yard. Behind the fence, sitting peacefully, was a mid-sized dog.

""Hello!"" said the dog.

""Holy shit!"" I said. ""You really are a talking dog!""

""Yes,"" the dog said. ""It's one of my many talents and accomplishments.""

""Amazing! What else have you done?"" I said.

""Well I was first employed during the war in Afghanistan, and the army used my talents to sniff out land mines. I would go into the desert and sniff them out so our soliders could safely cross and keep the peace in the area.""

""Really?""

""Yes. And after a few years of that I was employed as an overseas diplomat of sorts, doing goodwill missions to many countries, lecturing for children in schools, and raising money for victims of malaria.""

""That's incredible.""

""And then I realized it was time for me to return to my homeland, so I came back, earned a PhD from Harvard, and now I like to relax in the countryside here on this beautiful farm.""

""That's amazing. Well, nice to meet you dog! I'll be seeing you soon!""

""Thanks!"" said the dog. ""It was nice meeting you as well!""

"A duck got trampled. 

A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. 

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away."" 

The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?"" ""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet.. 

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something."" 

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. 

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" 

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.. 

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!"" 

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.""",Jokes,Inflation at the veterinarians office

"He looks out, and sees that the river is far too wide to swim, lest he tire and drown. He would have tried making a raft, but there were no trees in sight, nor any other manner of building material. Stumped but determined, he decided to follow the river until he reached a point where the river narrows, or where he could find materials to construct a raft. 

Heading out, he went upriver until he came to a lake. In the middle of the lake there was a small island with four trees. ""I could make it to the island, it isn't too far. And if I tire too much, I'll rest. I can even build a raft for the remaining journey if I so choose,"" he said.

Plunging into the water, he found that the cold sapped the energy far from him far faster than he expected, and by the time he reached the island he had nearly drowned several times due to his level of exhaustion. Dragging himself onto shore, and up to the relative shelter of the four trees, he curled up and his consciousness faded. 

Waking suddenly, slightly more rested, and realizing just how close he was to life threatening hypothermia, he began to fell a tree in the manner that he had been instructed as a young boy. After taking down the other three, he used their branches to fix the four trees together the best that he could, and then labored to push the raft into the water. 

By the time he reached the opposite end of the lake, he was battered. Staying on course had taken all of his strength, and nearly all his will to continue. Even when he became aware of the flashing lights and rush of men in reflective clothing lifting him onto a stretcher, he felt that what he had endured had broken him so completely, that any life regained may not be worth the enduring pain that would be with him until the end. He realized that there was nothing inherently valuable about his experience. He didn't feel as though he learned something about life, love, or risk. He couldn't look back fondly on any one instance. He didn't even see it being a funny story that he'd one day tell his grand children. The only solace he could find in his experience was that at least it wasn't frequently reposted on r/jokes.",Jokes,"A man reaches a river, and ponders how to cross."

It's Thanksgiving morning.  The old man is sleeping in and the old lady is in the initial steps of preparing the turkey.  While she has a handful of turkey innards, she gets an idea:

She tiptoes up the stairs and into the bedroom.  She carefully pulls back the waistband of her husband's jockey shorts and loads him up with warm turkey guts.

An hour later the woman hears him stirring.  She hears his feet hit the floor and then the normal fart-laugh sequence.  The laugh stops abruptly and is followed by a scream, and then 10 minutes of utter silence.

The man eventually comes down the stairs and says to his wife:  ""Honey, I owe you an apology.  For years, you've been telling me that I was going to fart my guts out.  Today it finally happened, but by the grace of God and these 2 fingers (raises soiled 1st and 2nd digit) I got 'em all back in and I'm gonna be OK.""",Jokes,Thanksgiving

""Hey, if you get me out of this trap and help heal my leg, I'll give you three wishes!""

The golfer was already intending to help the fox, so he pulled open the trap and got the fox to the vet. After the fox was healed and the golfer brought the him home, the golfer inquired about the wishes.

""Yes"" said the fox ""you get three wishes, but there is a catch. Everything you wish for, your evil boss will get double.""

So for his first wish, the golfer asked for a billion dollars. ""Of course"" said the fox ""but your boss just got two billion dollars""

For his second wish, the golfer asked to live to be a hundres years old, in perfect health the entire time. ""Okay, but do you really want the vile filth you work for to live two hundred years? Think of the evil he will cause in that time!""

Washington and meets president Barack Obama...

The instructor told Mori Prime Minister,

when you shake hand with President Obama, please say 'how ru'.

Then Mr. Obama should say, 'I am fine, and you?' Now, you should

say 'me too'. Afterwards we, translators, will do the work for you.'

It looks quite simple, but the truth is...

When Mori met Obama ,

he mistakenly said 'who r u?' (Instead of 'How ru?'.)

Mr. Obama was a bit shocked but still managed to react with humor:

'Well, I'm Michelle's husband, ha-ha..'

Then Mori replied 'me too, ha-ha.. ..

"Joe's dream was to get a 4wd and go 4 wheel driving. He had often seen videos and clips of people driving over sand dunes and thought it would be fun.He collects offroad magazines, and eventually thinks he knows all there is to offroading, while never actually having any experience. At the end of the year, Joe gets his work Christmas bonus, the very next day he is at a used car lot, and buys himself an affordable, used 4wd.

Eager to organise a trip, he calls up his friends to share the news and to see if anyone wanted to go away with him in his car, or bring their own for a little off road adventure. its no surprise that everyone is busy with family, or prior commitments.

Not to be discouraged, Joe makes his own plans. He looks through his magazines and finds a place that is a few hours away from him that has really good sand dunes. He calls up and books accommodation at a small town near the dunes, throws a bag of clothes in the car, and sets off. Eventually he gets to this little town late at night.

The next morning, bright and early, he sets off for the sand dunes. He leaves the town, and drives offroad for nearly an hour until he comes to the area he was looking for. On the very first dune, THE VERY FIRST! He rolls his car and its a complete wreck.He sits in the wreck and it takes him a while to for the shock to wear off and for him to realise the damage. Crawling out of the broken windows, he begins to assess his situation. The car is totalled. Its burning hot, and he has little to no water with him. Reaching for his phone to call for help he realises its not there. Its not in the car, and for the life of him, he cant see it anywhere on the sand up or down the dune.

As the sun beats down on him, he realises that he needs to save himself. He needs to walk back to town. He heads off in what he thinks is the shortest route to the town.As he walks, the sun is beating down on him, and the hot sand is scorching his feet through his shoes, but eventually he sees what looks like a road, and he heads for it. He then starts walking on the road. By luck, a sign confirmed that it was indeed a road to the town he was staying at and just a few miles to go. In fact he could see a large building on the outskirts of town. Just a little more to go.

Someone on a bicycle rode past him, then stopped when seeing his appearance. ""Water...."" begged Joe. ""Sorry mate, I dont have water with me, all I have is a mask"" he says as he pulls a mask from his pocket to hand to Joe. Joe waved him away... ""all i need is water"". As Joe hobbles along, its not long before another person on a bicycle rode past him, again he begs ""water..."". ""Sorry mate, all I can give you is a mask"", again Joe waves him off. Step by step joe marched on, he is so close, he can see the building. Less then 100ft away from the entrance of this building he collapses from exhaustion. In his head, he is screaming at his body to keep going.  ""Its mind over matter""... and he uses the last of his energy to crawl up to the front door.

The security on the front door stood and towered over Joe.

""water"" Joe feebly begs.

""yeah, we have plenty of water, its free for all of our visitors and our guests, and you can have as much as you want.

But you cant come in without a mask.""",Jokes,Fun with sand dunes

The ad stated that her ideal man is ""kind, sincere, did not hit or kick..."" (obvious condition after putting up with her dead husband's abuse) ""...and good in bed"". The last bit was a reference to the only attribute her husband had that made her happy.

not long after running the ad, she hears her doorbell ring, but didn't see anyone through her peephole. Opening the door after a second ring, she discovered a man in a wheelchair, waiting to greet her.

""Hi, I'm here about your ad?"" taken aback but, not wanting to discriminate, the woman asked the wheelchair bound man what makes him think he's a good fit.

""Well, as you can see, I can't kick. and as for the hitting, I'm so low off the ground I wouldn't be able to get any hits in vital spots like your face and such. Also, I'm just a plain old non abusive person, so...""

He looks to his left and to his shock, sees a chicken with what appeared to be three legs along side the car. Looking down, at the speedometer, he exclaims: “holyshit this thing is doing 50 mph!” 

As the chicken zooms past and overtakes the driver, the chicken darts right into a nearby farm. Completely perplexed the driver follows the chicken up the pathway into what looked like a huge farmstead. 

The driver gets out of the car and notices a farmer nearby tending to his daily routine. 

The driver approaches the farmer and says: “sorry to interrupt but I think I’ve just seen the strangest thing. I thought I saw what looked like a three-legged chicken on the highway and it seemed to turn into your farm!”

The farmer replied: “oh yeah we breed those here, got hundreds of ‘em”. He notes proudly: “We’re the only farm in the country that has three-legged chickens”. 

Astonished at what he has heard, the driver asked the farmer what made him decide to breed this abnormal chicken. 

The farmer replied: “well everyone in my family loves drumsticks. I love ‘em, my wife loves ‘em and my son does too, and we hate having to eat two chickens and have a drumstick left over”.

"Am Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman are lost deep in a jungle. They get captured by a tribe of cannibals and are told ""you can have one request before we kill you, eat you and then your skins into a canoe"". The scot asks for a bottle of the finest scotch and, somehow the tribe brings it to him. They then kill and skin him. The Englishman asks for a massive english breakfast and the tribe brings it to him. Once he is done eating he is killed and skinned. The Irishman asks for a fork. The tribesmen are confused but they bring him a fork. The Irishman then stabs himself repeatedly and says ""that's fucked yer canoe hasn't it?"".

Their first opponent is the dread-sorcerer Shang Tsung. 
  
   
The Spartan goes first, and quickly overpowers Shang Tsung, but is unsure of what to do next. Shang Tsung then speaks a word of power and the Spartan trips over his own cape and impales himself headfirst upon his own spear. Shang Tsung laughs and steals his soul.
   
Next up is the Samurai. He too quickly dominates Shang Tsung, but is unsure of what to do next. Shang Tsung then speaks his word of power and the Samurai turns his katana around and seppukus himself. Again, Shang Tsung laughs and steals his soul.
  
Finally it is the Skald's turn. Like the two before him he quickly beats the sorcerer's ass, but then he starts singing and chanting. Shang Tsung speaks his word of power but the Skald does not hear it over all the singing and chanting. The Skald then swaggers up to Shang Tsung, does the splits and punches the dread-sorcerer square in the nuts before beheading him with a single uppercut. Then he laughs and steals Shang Tsung's soul. Out of the three, only the Skald knows how to Finnish Hymn.

"The year is 2120, and our story follows Joe McFlinch and his journey to overcome his inner demons. 'Who is Joe?', you may be wondering. Well, Joe is a cowardly 29 year old male. He has no special talents or skills, no hobbies, and most sadly, no friends. If I were to describe him as a dish, he would be a singular plain toast because none of the other bread slices wanted anything to do with him.

Now that I have painted the picture for our protagonist, let me describe the setting: Joe's parents' basement, or as he likes to call it, his humble abode. Joe was sitting at his desk (which could clean itself by the way, the future is awesome), wondering how it all went wrong.

How did I end up like this, Joe thought to himself, I used to be cool! Joe was referring to when he was five and was the fastest kid in his kindergarten class.

""That's it!"" Joe sprung up from his chair and exclaimed, ""I'm going to show the world that Joe McFlinch is no wimp!""
""Keep it down Joe! I am trying to cook!"" His mother, who was stir-frying cricket brisket with the Hungertron 4000, was not pleased with his sudden outburst.
""Sorry Ma!"" Joe responded.

Now, Joe was fuelled with determination, but he did not have the avenue to showcase his courage (or lack thereof). Just then, Joe's 4D holographic phone went off: It was an advertisement for the Prehistoric Park, a theme park that showcased dinosaurs, ancient mammals and other prehistoric megafauna (It was based off the 1993 movie Jurassic Park).
""Introducing our latest addition!"" The announcer in the advert said, ""The one, the only, Tyrannosaurus Rex!""
Joe nearly collapsed upon hearing the majestic beast's roar.
""It's really strong! It's really overly aggressive! And it's REALLY HUGEEEEEEE!"" The announcer continued. Then, almost like one of those medicine ads where the speaker goes high pitched and super fast while talking about the side effects, the ad went, ""Do not bring outside food into the park, no flash photography as it may startle our animals, Prehistoric Park is not liable for any injuries or damages that happen within our park, thank you and have a nice day!""

An overly aggressive dinosaur huh, Joe thought to himself. Just then, Joe had a eureka moment. If I piss it off, people are sure to respect my guts! (I said he had a eureka moment, but I did not specify that it was good)

Now, Joe had a camera and a plan. He was going to use his camera's flash to startle the 'really overly aggressive' dinosaur, proving to the world that he was not a coward. Any sane person would question Joe's flawed logic but since he had no friends to challenge him, he was going all in on his plan.

The day came when Joe made his visit to Prehistoric Park. Upon seeing the Tyrannosaurus up close, he was starting to have second thoughts. The announcer was right about two things, the dinosaur was really strong and really huge. It was now up to Joe to find out whether or not it was really overly aggressive.

Joe took a deep breath. You're a loser Joe! Just a big fat chicken! Joe started to recall all the insults and demeaning things bullies used to sling at him, Coward! Wimp! Chicken! He hated that word, chicken.

""I am NOT A CHICKEN!"" Joe yelled as he aimed his camera at the dinosaur.
Click!

A jumbo digital multi-lens hyper reflex camera's flash was no joke, comparable to a flash bang grenade. Needless to say, the Tyrannosaurus was not happy. It turned at Joe and once it pinpointed him as the source of the flare, it started charging.

'That IS a really overly aggressive dinosaur!' was Joe's last thought as the monster broke through the 4-inch carbon nanotube fence and chewed him up in one bite.

Poor Joe. No one knew why he acted the way he did. The authorities labelled the incident as a mentally unstable individual that committed suicide through dinosaur.
But you and I both know.
You and I both know why Joe did it, that all he was trying to do was to prove himself.

"And he gets separated while chasing butterflies.  Pretty soon the dog looks around and realizes he's lost.  He wanders into a clearing and on the other side he sees a jaguar.  

The jaguar has never seen a dog before and hesitates, wondering ""what kind of animal is that?"" but the dog thinks ""Oh shit!  It's a jaguar!"" and starts running.

The jaguar gives chase!

While running, the dog comes across a pile of animal bones and suddenly stops, waiting for the jaguar to catch up.  Slowly the jaguar approaches but the dog just waits while it sneaks up on him.  When the jaguar is very close the dog says loudly ""Yummy!  What a delicious jaguar I just ate!""

After they dress the deer and tag it, they grab it by its hind legs and start dragging through the woods back to the car. A game warden happens on the pair and, after checking their tags and admiring the buck tells them that they are dragging the deer out all wrong. By dragging it by the rear legs, the snow, leaves and dirt are getting caught by the animal's fur, and the horns are getting all tangled in the brush. The warden suggests that they drag it by the front legs. They agree to try it and much to their surprise, it is much easier dragging the deer this way. After a half-hour of this Sven turns to Ole and says, ""Boy dat game warden vas right, it sure is easier dragging de deer dis way, but ya know, we are getting further away from de car.""",Jokes,"Ethnic jokes are unacceptable.
