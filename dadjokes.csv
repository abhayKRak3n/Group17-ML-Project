"A man was wanting to get a mural painted in his house. He ran an ad in the local newspaper and a painter showed up at his house sometime later, but he seemed to be a little stoned. 
The man explained that he wanted to get a mural of Custers last stand and the painter said that he could take care of it‚Ä¶no problem. Since he was the only one to answer the ad the man decided to go with this painter.
 ‚ÄúOne thing‚Äù, he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna have to leave for a week while you do the painting. Is that gonna be a problem? ‚ÄúThe painter says ‚Äúno man won‚Äôt be a problem at all I‚Äôll take care of it.‚Äù
The man returns a week later and as he walks in his house from vacation he sees the Mural on his wall and is immediately aggravated. 
The Mural has beautiful green rolling Hills. On the crest of the hill on the left is a Holstein cow, standing on her back legs with one hoof over her eyes as if to shade her sight from the sun. A glowing halo is above the cows head. 
In the valley on the right there is a large cotton field filled with people with white cotton bags over their shoulders. The man looks closely at the people thinking that they are slaves from the pre-civil war South, but realizes that they are instead native Americans, or Indians‚Ä¶and they are harvesting cotton. 
He is now fuming mad and just then the painter shows up to get paid. They start arguing and the man says ‚ÄúI asked for Custer‚Äôs last stand!  What is this crap?‚Äù
The painter says ‚ÄúCalm down, I did paint Custer‚Äôs last stand, from Custer‚Äôs perspective ‚Äú.

"I recently introduced my boys to the fantastic world of up close magic. This includes such things as making bouncy balls dissappear and making those balls reappear. That's it. Making the balls reappear in new and creative places has been the real entertainment for everyone as I try to keep it fresh until this latest attempt at least.

As I did this trick for 2 yo son I told him it looked like he had something up his nose. So I ""helped"" him get it out and bam wouldn't you know it's the bouncy ball that had just disappeared. 

His face when it appeared was priceless! It went back and forth from astonishment to confused to very concerned to laughing to fearful contemplation of the potential horrors that this trick may cause to happen.

TLDR: I feel so pathetic not being able to speak French well.

I‚Äôve decided to dedicate my life to this labour of learning French (sounds cult-like, I know, but I really feel a strong sense of passion for what I‚Äôm doing) (that is, I don‚Äôt aspire to be the idiots who claim to speak 20 languages but can only utter a few simple words and phrases). And after that, maybe I‚Äôll learn a couple more- Russian perhaps?

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm terrible at them: for Spanish, I‚Äôve reached a pretty good level- for those who know the CEFR scale, it‚Äôs around the C1 level, while for Italian and Portuguese, I do have an intermediate level when it comes to writing and listening and reading comprehension, but I struggle with speaking at times due to lack of vocabulary. 

However, I feel a little (actually, very) upset  because ever since I started learning French 5-6 days ago (1 week I guess), I have been learning 20+ words everyday. I do everything possible. I write (or type) each of them down, put them in Anki, with definitions, examples and tags (eg. verb, adjective). However when I try to recall them the next day, I am unable to remember about 80-85% of them. And let‚Äôs not even talk about what I‚Äôve learnt the day before. 

This is not a question of goals either (I am learning languages for the sole purpose of learning the language- anything else is a result of that).

I‚Äôm missing out on so many words that could potentially enrich my vocabulary and hamper my progress in French. It sucks. 

I‚Äôve even started writing on r/writestreak but the writing process is so difficult- I have constantly refer to a dictionary and a ‚Äúsentence dictionary‚Äù AKA reverso to formulate many of my sentences because I don‚Äôt know so many words. It takes me 1-2h just to write around 200+ words.

Besides that, the grammar is so difficult. In every single one of the languages that I have learnt, I have never felt so overwhelmed by the grammar before. It is/ was either manageable or a breeze. 

My routine (so you understand why I feel this way- it‚Äôs hard to squeeze in another language this way, isn‚Äôt it? ): I go all-out to study and try my very best at all 3 languages. For each of them I read/ used to read multiple newspapers and books from 4-5 different countries EVERYDAY, listen to podcasts in each language, write at least a 200-word essay in 2 languages every week, and try to squeeze in a couple of hours of speaking practise, if time and energy level permits. I‚Äôve essentially transformed my routine into one reminiscent of a military base/camp, no frills with a lot of drills- at least for now. (Read Alexander Arg√ºelles- my routine is almost similar to his)

*I don‚Äôt learn languages to stop halfway- that is to say, I‚Äôm not willing to learn any language just to learn basic phrases, words and grammar- If I‚Äôm learning, I‚Äôm learning all the way and for life.

"They snuck from their beds in the middle of the night and met in the gloomy darkness in front of the house, shivering in the cold.

The first boy said in a loud whisper, ""You guys bring anything?"" He slid a gun out of his pocket. The second boy nodded and revealed a knife. The third boy pulled out a flashlight.

""You didn't bring a weapon?"" the first boy asked. He shrugged and replied, ""Sorry"". And as if to prove it, he turned his pockets out to show nothing but stray lint and a pack of cough drops.

They crept in. The door shut behind them. It was pitch black and stone quiet. They were suddenly starting to regret this dare. The flash light clicked on. The aggressive darkness and inky black yielded with grudging compliance but always seeming to push back. They moved cautiously onward amid the dust and cobwebs. The floor creaked. They breathed in tight, quick breaths. You could hear a pin drop.

Suddenly, there was a deep moan. ""OOOOOOOOUUUUU"". It seemed from below them. The house had been abandoned for years. Who or what could make such a sound? The boys looked at each other, but continued on, hearts pounding in their chests.

As they proceeded into the kitchen they encountered a swarm of flies. Buzzing and beating their necks and faces, they rushed and stumbled to the door on the other side, not stopping to see what they were truly feasting on. They slammed the door behind them. Maybe a dead body? But no way were they going back to find out. And again came the sound, ""ooooOOOOOooooOOUUU"" but louder this time, and closer.

They proceeded through the dark into the dining room. They found a fully set, ornate dining table covered in cob webs. Dust-covered regal goblets, pitchers and silverware adorned the table. Spiders crept over ivory plates. Clearly a house of privilege and set for a grand feast which never happened.

Or, perhaps, met a fatal end?

They pushed on. But again that unearthly howl.

""oooooOOOOOOOOOOOUuuuuUUUUuuUUOOOOooo"".

They found the basement staircase, and from below, the sounds seemed to be emanating. Could they proceed? Would they? Did they dare? Two of the boys looked at each other, faces filled with worry.

But the third said confidently, ""We're going down there."" Not wanting to seem the weaker, the other two boys steeled themselves and nodded.

The stairs creaked and groaned evily under their feet. The rickety banister shook in angry defiance. Insects and vermin scattered underneath them with every step. They were descending into hell, they knew, but none would turn back.

And the unholy sound intensified: *""oOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUuuuuUUOOOO""*. Now closer and loud enough to fill not only their heads but seeming to claw at their very souls!

Now at the basement door! The antique, crying squeak of the hinges *eeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEee* made the boys wince and almost cover their ears. But they had to know. WHAT is making that horrible, terrible sound?

**""ooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUoooooUUUUUUUOOOOOOO""**

In the center of the basement lay an unholy coffin! A twisted artistic expression of murder, decay and disease! Brutish, incorrect lengths had been forced together, buckling the wood and bulging the steel at points, as if death, itself, were attempting to escape. It was festooned with beast-like emblems and decrepit artifacts: skulls, antlers, skins, totems, and drenched in the color of blood!

It was TRUE! The house really was haunted!

**""OOOoooOOOoOOooOoOouuUUUUUuuuuUOOuouOUOOOOOOOOUuuuuuoooOOOOOOOOO""**

Now the boys realized with sheer horror that the insane moaning was definitely coming from the coffin!

Before the boys could turn and run, the coffin began to shake! They froze! Then it suddenly LIFTED off the ground! They GAPED in terror!

Shaking violently and rising, the coffin started to turn. It turned and turned, and gained speed. It was spinning in the air before them! A mix of terror and fascination gripped them. Unable to look away. Unable to run! It spun faster and faster AND FASTER!

# ""OOOoooOOOoOOooOoOouuUUUUUuuuuUOOuouOUOOOOOOOoouuOOOO""

The first boy with the knife slashed in the air in front of him, as if to stab away at the evil! Then he dropped the knife and ran back up the stairs, never to be seen again!

The second boy with the gun fired warning shots at the ceiling BANG! BANG!, but then thought better of it, dropped the gun and also ran up the stairs, never to be seen again!

The third boy stood there calmly, reached into his pocket and popped a cough drop into his mouth. He sucked on it for a bit.

And the coffin stopped.",dadjokes,Three boys go into a haunted house

"After four days of nothing to eat I was delirious from starvation. In my desperation I went hunting for the first thing that looked remotely appetizing. Soon I stumbled upon an indigenous macaque, and with a focused throw of my spear I skewered it in one hit.

Only half the battle was over, though. I had no idea what to do with this corpse. I've cooked easy things like beef, poultry, and pork but never a monkey. Fortunately, a wandering traveler came by, so I asked him how I should prepare it. He said, ""That's easy. Just boil the monkey. Nice and fast."" Then he left.

While it did sound easy, boiled meat usually doesn't taste good. However, another wandering traveler soon meandered by, so I asked him what to do. He said, ""If you're patient and want good flavor, slowly spit roast the monkey over a fire."" He then walked away.

That sounded much better, but I was too hungry to wait that long. As fate would have it, a third wandering traveler sauntered by, so I asked for his advice. He said, ""If you're pressed for time but still want something delicious, then skin the monkey, render its fat, and deep fry the meat in its own fat."" He went on his way.

I had three unique options to pick from, and while I hadn't immediately chosen one I definitely learned something new:
